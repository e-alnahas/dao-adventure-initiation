Welcome to **Motoko Bootcamp** ðŸ‘‹ This is a guided tutorial to help you deploy your 1st application on the **Internet Computer** in under 5 minutes ðŸ¤¯ You don't need any prior setup to use this repository.

## ðŸ“œ The legend of Motoko Academy 
_In a parallel digital universe, the vast digital realm was divided into various land. One such luxurious land was the **Internet Computer**. The **Internet Computer** was for all a land of hope, progress and dream. <br/>Rising above the clouds of this domain, was the prestigious **Motoko Academy**. Here, novices transformed into digital architects and shaped the future of this land._  

_The academy had an initiation ritual that every aspirant had to go through - "**The 1st dApp Challenge**". Only by conquering this challenge would they be granted the chance to enter the academy._ 

_At the center of the academy was the **Digital Legacy Scroll**. Everytime a student successfully created their app, their name and a short message about their hopes and dreams were added to this ongoing list. It was not just a list, it was a live showcase for the hard work and success for everyone at the academy to see and appreciate._

_The rewards didn't end with the scroll. Those who got onto the list  were also given the keys to **OpenChat**, a unique digital room for the best of the best. It was a sanctuary for the curious and ambitious.Legends say that within **OpenChat** secrets to forging a DAO were reveleaded._

_At Motoko Academy, the goal wasn't just coding; it was about changing the digital world. And so, in the heart of the **Internet Computer**, the story of Motoko Academy grew, training the next wave of app and DAO makers._

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Turn
Do you think the **Internet Computer** sounds too good to be true? Let me prove you wrong. In a few minutes, you'll chat with me directly from it. <br/>

We will use an application called **OpenChat**. <br/>
**OpenChat** is a fully featured chat application running end-to-end on the Internet Computer. OpenChat is also the first application to be completely controlled by a DAO, the **OpenChat DAO**.

To gain access to the group, you must first complete and deploy your application in [main.mo](src/main.mo). Only after doing so will the secret code be revealed.
