> Welcome to **Motoko Bootcamp** ðŸ‘‹ <br/> This is a guided tutorial to help you deploy your 1st application on the **Internet Computer** in under 5 minutes ðŸ¤¯ <br/> You don't need any prior setup to use this repository.

## ðŸ“œ The legend of Motoko Academy 
In a parallel digital universe, the vast digital realm was divided into various land. One such luxurious land was the **Internet Computer**. The **Internet Computer** was for all a land of hope, progress and dream. <br/>Rising above the clouds of this domain, was the prestigious **Motoko Academy**. Here, novices transformed into digital architects and shaped the future of this land.  

The academy had an initiation ritual that every aspirant had to go through - "**The 1st dApp Challenge**". Only by conquering this challenge would they be granted the chance to enter the academy. 

At the center of the academy was the **Digital Legacy Scroll**. Everytime a student successfully created their app, their name and a short message about their hopes and dreams were added to this ongoing list. It was not just a list, it was a live showcase for the hard work and success for everyone at the academy to see and appreciate.

The rewards didn't end with the scroll. Those who got onto the list  were also given the keys to **OpenChat**, a unique digital room for the best of the best. It was a sanctuary for the curious and ambitious.Legends say that within **OpenChat** secrets to forging a DAO were reveleaded.

At Motoko Academy, the goal wasn't just coding; it was about changing the digital world. And so, in the heart of the **Internet Computer**, the story of Motoko Academy grew, training the next wave of app and DAO makers.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Turn
Do you think the **Internet Computer** sounds too good to be true? Let me prove you wrong. In a few minutes, you'll chat with me directly from it. <br/>

We will use an application called **OpenChat**. <br/>
**OpenChat** is a fully featured chat application running end-to-end on the Internet Computer. OpenChat is also the first application to be completely controlled by a DAO, the **OpenChat DAO**.

To gain access to the group, you must first complete and deploy your application in [main.mo](src/main.mo). Only after doing so will the secret code be revealed.
